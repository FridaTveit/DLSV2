    <h3>Software for document reading</h3>
    <p>Most computers already have the software to open these document formats. If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader (for reading PDFs), it is available from the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe website (external)</a>. If you do not have Winzip (for opening zip files), you can download a free trial from the <a href="http://www.winzip.com/index.htm">Winzip website (external)</a>.</p>
    <h3>Saving documents to your computer</h3>
    <p>If you have a PC, right-click on the link to the document. If you use an Apple Mac, hold down the mouse button over the link. In both cases, a popup menu will then appear. Scroll down the menu and click on 'Save target as'. You will then be asked to choose a folder on your computer where you can save the document.</p>
    <p>Assistive technologies such as screen readers may have their own specific way to save documents, please refer to your preferred software's Help section.</p>
